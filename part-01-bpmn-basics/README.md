# Part 1 - BPMN Basics

In this assignment, you’ll evolve a simple image production process into a more advanced version by adding a sub-process with decision logic. You will begin with a boilerplate BPMN file located in the **part-01-bpmn-basics/starter** folder and use the **Camunda Web Modeler** to complete your work.

---

## ⏳ Time Available

You have approximately **20 minutes** available to complete all activities in Part 1, including modeling, testing, and exploring your BPMN process.

---

## 📁 Files

- `part-01-bpmn-basics/starter/p1s-image-production-process.bpmn`  
  → This is your **starting point**: a basic process that includes model upload and image rendering steps.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By completing this assignment, you will learn how to:

- Extend a BPMN process using **sub-processes**
- Model decisions using **exclusive gateways**
- Use and configure **service tasks** effectively

---

## ✅ Instructions

### 1. Open the Starter BPMN File

Upload `p1s-image-production-process.bpmn` to your dedicated training folder in the **Camunda Web Modeler**.  
Take a moment to explore the process, which currently includes:

- A **Start Event**
- A **Service Task** for uploading a model
- A **Receive Task** for waiting for the rendered image
- An **End Event**

> **Note:**  
> The first task ("Upload Model") is an **orchestrated task**, meaning it triggers the production of a model. This can either be carried out directly by the job worker or delegated to a backend service through the worker.  
>  
> The "Render Image" step is a **receive task**, which waits for an external event to signal that image rendering is complete.  
>  
> This highlights a key principle: in this process, we are primarily **tracking the flow** of external work, rather than **managing** or **performing** the work inside the process itself.

### 2. Add a Sub-Process for Image Enhancement

In the **Camunda Web Modeler**, activate the **Space Tool** from the palette to create some room between the "Render Image" step and the final end event. Then insert a **Task** element (also found in the palette) into the newly created space.

1. Click on the **Change element** icon and select **"Sub-Process (collapsed)"**.
2. Label the sub-process: **"Enhance Image"**.
3. This sub-process will later be expanded to contain decision logic for whether or not to enhance the image.

### 3. Model the Decision Logic Inside the Sub-Process

Inside the sub-process, perform the following steps:

1. **Expand** the sub-process to start modeling inside it.
2. Add a **Start Event**.
3. Add an **Exclusive Gateway** and label it:  
   ➔ **"Should the image be enhanced?"**
4. From the gateway, create two branches:
   - **Yes path**:  
     ➔ Lead to a **Service Task** labeled **"Enhance Image"**,  
     ➔ Then connect it to a new, **unlabeled Exclusive Gateway**.
   - **No path**:  
     ➔ Connect directly to the same **unlabeled Exclusive Gateway**.
5. Connect the **unlabeled Exclusive Gateway** to an **End Event** labeled:  
   ➔ **"High-Quality Image Achieved"**.
6. On the **Yes path** sequence flow:
   - Set it as a **Condition Expression**.
   - Use the expression:  
     ➔ `imageRenderingQuality < 0.7`
7. On the **No path** sequence flow:
   - Click on the **Change Type** icon.
   - Set it as the **Default Flow**.
8. Select the **"Enhance Image"** service task:
   - Set its **Job Type** to:  
     ➔ `image-enhancement`

## 🎮 Using Play to Debug Your Diagram

In Camunda, **Play** is a built-in tool that allows you to deploy, test, and debug your BPMN models directly within the Web Modeler.

Follow these steps to test your process:

1. Click on the **Play** tab (next to **Design** and **Implement**).
2. Select the **Training Cluster**.
3. Wait for the model to be deployed.
4. Click on the **three dots** next to the blue play button and select **"Edit variables and start instance"**.
5. Insert the following JSON document into the variables field:
    ```json
    {
      "modelId": "mid-1"
    }
    ```
6. Click on **Create instance** to start a new instance of your process model.
7. Click on the **blue checkmark button** to complete the **Upload Model** service task manually.
8. The next step is to **notify the process** that the rendering system has completed its work by sending a **message** to the process engine.
9. Click on the **three dots** next to the envelope icon and select **"Edit variables and publish message"**.
10. Insert the following JSON document into the variables field:
    ```json
    {
      "imageId": "iid-1",
      "imageRenderingQuality": 0.6
    }
    ```
11. Set the **Message Correlation Key** to match the model ID:
    ```
    mid-1
    ```

    > ℹ️ **Note:** In BPMN, *message correlation* ensures that a published message reaches the correct waiting process instance.  
    > The correlation key acts like a unique ID to link the message to a specific running instance.  
    > If no process instance is waiting with a matching correlation key, the message is ignored or held, depending on configuration.

12. Publish the message to correlate it with the correct process instance.
13. Finally, enter your sub-process and manually complete the **Enhance Image** service task by selecting **Edit variables and complete job**.
14. Insert the following JSON document into the variables field:
    ```json
    {
      "imageEnhancementQuality": 0.8
    }
    ```
15. Click **Complete job** and check out the instance variables.
---

> ✅ At this point, you have successfully tested and debugged your enhanced BPMN model using Play!  

> ➕ To explore the process further, try starting another instance with a different `imageRenderingQuality` value that takes the **alternative path** through the sub-process.

> 🎯 If you have time left, feel free to explore Play even further — try rewinding the process, adding new variables, or changing existing values to see how the flow reacts.
