# Part 4 - Instance Incident Handling

In this assignment, you will handle **technical errors** thrown from a job worker.

---

## ⏳ Time Available

You have approximately **20 minutes** to complete all activities in Part 4.

---

## 📁 Files

- `part-04-instance-incident-handling/starter/p3s-image-production-process.bpmn`  
  → Your **starting point**: a basic process that includes model upload and image rendering steps.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By completing this assignment, you will:

- Understand how Camunda handles technical incidents during process execution  
- Simulate and analyze recoverable and non-recoverable errors  
- Use **Camunda Operate** to inspect incidents and **Camunda Web Modeler** to enhance your process  
- Modify your BPMN model to implement proper incident-handling strategies

---

## ✅ Instructions

### 1. Open the Starter BPMN File

- Upload `p3s-image-production-process.bpmn` to your dedicated training folder in the **Camunda Web Modeler**.
- Open the file and locate the **Model Uploading** service task.

---

### 2. Task Configuration – Retries

- Click on the **Model Uploading** service task.
- In the properties panel, locate the **Retries** field under the task definition.
- Note: If the field is empty, the default value is **3** retries.
  > This means the job will automatically be retried up to 3 times by the engine before an incident is raised.
- For the purpose of this exercise, you can explicitly set the value to **3** to ensure consistent behavior during testing.

## 🚀 Deploy Your Process Diagram

- In the **Camunda Web Modeler**, click **Deploy** to push your updated BPMN model to your training cluster.

## ▶️ Execute Your Process Diagram with Incidents

### 1. Incident with Recoverable Error

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the `python/windows` folder.
3. Start the job worker using:
   ```bash
   python part-04-runner-online.py
   ```
4. Ensure the worker starts correctly and connects to the cluster.
5. Open another terminal and navigate to the `clients` folder inside the `python` directory.
6. Start a process instance using:
   ```bash
   python start-image-production-process.py mid_1
   ```
7. Observe the repeating outputs in the job worker terminal:
   ```
   📦 Received modelId: mid_1
   ❌ Invalid modelId format! Expected: mid-<number>
   ⚠️ Exception caught: Invalid modelId format. Expected: mid-<number>
   ```

   > In **Pyzeebe 4.5.0**, you cannot directly set `retries = 0` within the job worker code to stop further retries. This behavior aligns with Zeebe’s design — the engine decrements retries automatically when a job fails.

   > To explicitly set retries to zero, you must use the **Zeebe REST API**.

8. Open **Camunda Operate** and locate your process instance that caused the incident.
9. The incident reason will show:
   ```
   Failed to run task model_uploading. Reason: Invalid modelId format. Expected: mid-<number>
   ```
10. In the **Variables** panel, find `modelId` and click the **edit (✏️) icon**.
11. Change the value to a valid format (e.g., `mid-1`).
12. Click **Retry Incident** to resume the process.
13. Observe the successful output in the worker terminal:
    ```
    📦 Received modelId: mid-1
    ✅ Model with modelId 'mid-1' was successfully uploaded.
    ```
14. To finish the instance, run:
    ```bash
    python send-image-rendering-message.py mid-1 iid-1 0.8
    ```

---

### 2. Incident with Non-Recoverable Error

> ⚠️ Stop the job workers first: `ctrl+C`

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the `python/windows` folder.
3. Start the job worker using:
   ```bash
   python part-04-runner-offline.py
   ```
4. Open another terminal and navigate to the `clients` folder.
5. Start a process instance:
   ```bash
   python start-image-production-process.py mid-1
   ```
6. Observe output like:
   ```
    📦 Simulating backend upload for modelId: mid-1
    🔁 Zeebe-reported retries remaining: 3
    ⚠️ Exception caught: Backend is offline.
    🔁 Remaining retries: 2
    ⏳ Setting backoff to 2000 ms

    📦 Simulating backend upload for modelId: mid-1
    🔁 Zeebe-reported retries remaining: 2
    ⚠️ Exception caught: Backend is offline.
    🔁 Remaining retries: 1
    ⏳ Setting backoff to 4000 ms

    📦 Simulating backend upload for modelId: mid-1
    🔁 Zeebe-reported retries remaining: 1
    ⚠️ Exception caught: Backend is offline.
    🔁 Remaining retries: 0
    ⏳ Setting backoff to 8000 ms
   ```

   > This simulates a persistent backend failure. Zeebe retries the job 3 times with exponential backoff. When retries reach 0, an incident is raised.

   > Refer to `model-uploading-offline.py` to understand how a job worker can dynamically set backoff durations and handle retry exhaustion.

7. Open **Camunda Operate** and inspect the incident.
8. Stop the offline worker: `ctrl+C`
9. Start the recoverable worker:
   ```bash
   python part-04-runner-online.py
   ```
10. Retry the incident in Operate.
11. Finalize the process:
    ```bash
    python send-image-rendering-message.py mid-1 iid-1 0.8
    ```
---

✅ You’ve now simulated both recoverable and non-recoverable errors using Python job workers.

> ➕ Continue below for advanced usage of **REST API-based incident handling**.

### 3. Incident with Recoverable Error Using REST API

> ⚠️ Stop the job workers first: `ctrl+C`

1. In Bruno, get an access token from `authentication/Get Access Token`.
2. Run `Create Fault Image Production Instance` with:
    ```json
    "modelId": "mid_1"
    ```
3. Open **Camunda Operate** and find the paused instance.
4. In Bruno, run `Activate Image Uploading Jobs`.

    > **Activation = job claimed by worker**. It must be activated before any action like failing or completing it.

5. Within 10 seconds, run:
    ```json
    {
      "retries": 0,
      "errorMessage": "Use the correct model identity format.",
      "retryBackOff": 0,
      "variables": {}
    }
    ```

    > **Explanation:** The job is failed, and retries are set to zero, causing an incident to be raised immediately.

6. In Operate, fix the variable (`modelId`) and retry the incident.
7. Re-activate the job.
8. Observe token advancing to next task.
9. Cancel the process when done.
