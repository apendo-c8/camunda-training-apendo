# Part 1 - FEEL Expressions

In this assignment, you’ll evolve the image production process into a more complete version by adding a multi-instance service task and a FEEL expression mapping image to a common collection to iterate over. You will begin with a boilerplate BPMN file located in the **part-05-feel-expression/starter** folder and use the **Camunda Web Modeler** to complete your work.

---

## ⏳ Time Available

You have approximately **20 minutes** available to complete all activities in Part 5, including modeling, testing, and exploring your BPMN process.

---

## 📁 Files

- `part-05-feel-expression/starter/p5s-image-production-process.bpmn`  
  → This is your **starting point**: a basic process that includes model upload and image rendering steps.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By completing this assignment, you will learn how to:

- Use FEEL expressions to dynamically generate a collection for iteration  
- Model sequential multi-instance service tasks  
- Configure input and output mapping within multi-instance tasks  

---

## ✅ Instructions

### 1. Open the Starter BPMN File

- Upload `p5s-image-production-process.bpmn` to your dedicated training folder in the **Camunda Web Modeler**.
- Open the file and locate the **Model Uploading** service task.

---

### 2. Add a Sequential Multi-instance for Asset Storage

In the **Camunda Web Modeler**, activate the **Space Tool** from the palette to create some room between the "Produce Thumbnails" step and the final end events. Then insert a **Task** element (also found in the palette) into the newly created space.

1. Click on the **Change element** icon and select **"Service Task"** and label it **Store Asset**.  
2. Click on the **Change element** icon again and select **Sequential Multi-instance** from the upper-right corner of the popup dialog.  
3. Expand the **Properties** panel and locate the **Multi-instance** section.  

    > ℹ️ **Note:**  
    > The Multi-instance section contains four fields:  
    > - **Input collection** – the list of values to iterate over.  
    > - **Input element** – the name of the variable used for each item in the collection during iteration.  
    > - **Output collection** – the name of the array that will store the results of each iteration.  
    > - **Output element** – the name of the variable used to return the result of each individual iteration.  

4. In the **Input collection** field, insert this FEEL expression:  
   ```javascript
   for x in 1..(count(thumbnailIds) + 1) return if x = 1 then imageId else thumbnailIds[x - 1]
   ```

    > ℹ️ **Note:**  
    > This expression builds a dynamic list that starts with the main `imageId`, followed by all the `thumbnailIds`.  
    > `x` ranges from 1 to the total count of thumbnails plus one.  
    > If `x` is 1, it returns the `imageId`.  
    > Otherwise, it retrieves the corresponding thumbnail ID by subtracting one from `x`.

5. In **Input element**, enter `imageId`.  
    > This defines the loop variable name. Each iteration of the multi-instance task will use `imageId` to represent the current value from the collection.

6. In **Output collection**, enter `assetIds`.  
    > After each iteration, the result (e.g. a stored asset reference) is collected into the `assetIds` array.

7. In **Output element**, enter `assetId`.  
    > This is the name of the variable returned by each instance of the task and added to the `assetIds` list.

## ▶️ Execute Your Process Diagram

### 1. Multi-instance Service Task with FEEL Expression

1. Open a terminal window.  
2. Navigate to the `python/windows` folder.  
3. Start the job worker using:  
   `python part-05-runner.py`  
4. Ensure the worker starts correctly and connects to the cluster.  
5. Open another terminal and navigate to the `clients` folder inside the `python` directory.  
6. Start a process instance using:  
   `python start-image-production-process.py mid-1`  
7. Send the rendering message:  
   `python send-image-rendering-message.py mid-1 iid-1 0.8`  
8. Watch the printout from your workers:  
    ```
    💾 Received asset: iid-1
    📦 Stored asset as: iid-1

    💾 Received asset: tid-1
    📦 Stored asset as: tid-1

    💾 Received asset: tid-2
    📦 Stored asset as: tid-2

    💾 Received asset: tid-3
    📦 Stored asset as: tid-3
    ```
9. Go to Operate and select Finished Instances and click on the one that was just completed.  
10. Extend the Variables panel and watch the `assetIds` list, which now includes all images that were stored as assets.

> ✅ At this point, you have successfully modeled and executed a process with a multi-instance task using FEEL expressions!

> ➕ To explore the process further, try changing the multi-instance task to **parallel** instead of sequential. Then monitor how all service task instances run simultaneously.

## 🏁 Outcome

By the end of this exercise, you’ll have transformed a linear BPMN model into a more dynamic, realistic process using decision logic and reusable modeling structures.

Great job and happy modeling! 🎉
