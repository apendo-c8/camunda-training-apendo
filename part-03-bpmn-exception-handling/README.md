# Part 3 - Exception Handling

In this assignment, you will extend the image production process by adding intermediate events that catch a **timeout** and a **business error** thrown from a job worker.

You will start with a boilerplate Python script located in the **part-03-exception-handling/starter** folder and use **VS Code** to complete your work.

---

## ‚è≥ Time Available

You have approximately **20 minutes** to complete all activities in Part 3, including programming, deployment, and executing your BPMN process.

---

## üìÅ Files

- `part-03-exception-handling/starter/p3s-image-production-process.bpmn`  
  ‚Üí Your **starting point**: a basic process that includes model upload and image rendering steps.  
- `part-03-exception-handling/starter/p3s-thumbnails-production.py`  
  ‚Üí A **starter Python script** that logs and returns thumbnails for an image. You will extend it to simulate and throw a business error.

---

## üéØ Learning Goals

By completing this assignment, you will:

- Learn how to model **Timer Intermediate Events** to catch timeouts  
- Learn how to model **Error Intermediate Events** to catch business errors  
- Modify a Python Job Worker to simulate error conditions  
- Understand how exceptions are handled and routed in BPMN  

---

## ‚úÖ Instructions

### 1. Open the Starter BPMN File

- Upload the file `p3s-image-production-process.bpmn` to your dedicated training folder in the **Camunda Web Modeler** and open it.

---

### 2. Add a Timer Intermediate Event

1. Extend the process to catch a **timeout** if the **Render Image** Receive Task takes too long to receive a message  
2. Attach a **Boundary Timer Event** to the **Render Image** Receive Task  
3. Set the **Duration** to `PT30S` (30 seconds)  
   - The duration must follow the **ISO 8601 duration format**, where `P` stands for "Period" and `T` introduces the time section. Example: `PT30S` = 30 seconds  
4. From the Timer Event, connect the flow to an **Exclusive Gateway** inserted immediately after the **Start Event**

---

### 3. Add an Error Intermediate Event

1. Attach a **Boundary Error Event** to the **Produce Thumbnails** service task  
2. In the Error section of the element properties panel, select **"Create new ..."**  
3. Set the **Name** to `ThumbnailProductionError`  
4. Set the **Error Code** to `thumbnail-production-error`  
5. Connect the Boundary Error Event to an **End Event** labeled **"Image Production Failed"**

---

### 4. Complete the Python Job Worker

1. Open the `p3s-thumbnails-production.py` script in **VS Code**  
2. Modify the `produce_thumbnails()` function to simulate a business rule violation:
   - If `imageRenderingQuality` is below `0.7` and `imageEnhancementQuality` is also below `0.7`, raise an error.
   - Otherwise, generate and return a list of thumbnail IDs.

   Example:

       if rendering_quality < 0.7 and enhancement_quality < 0.7:
           print("üéØ Throwing BPMN Error: thumbnail-production-error ‚Äì Image quality insufficient for thumbnails")
           raise Exception("Image quality insufficient for thumbnails!")

3. Add a custom exception handler:
   - This function will be triggered when the above exception is raised.
   - It will forward the error to Camunda as a BPMN error using `set_error_status()`.

   Example:

       async def example_exception_handler(exception: Exception, job: Job, job_controller: JobController) -> None:
           print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Error occurred during task {job.type}")
           print(f"‚ùå {exception}")
           await job_controller.set_error_status(
               message="Image quality insufficient for thumbnails",
               error_code="thumbnail-production-error"
           )

4. Assign the exception handler to the task:

       @worker.task(task_type="thumbnails_production", exception_handler=example_exception_handler)
       async def produce_thumbnails(job: Job):
           ...

## üöÄ Deploy Your Process Diagram

- In the **Camunda Web Modeler**, deploy your updated BPMN model to your training cluster

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execute Your Process Diagram

### 1. Exception handling caused by a Timeout

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the `python/windows` folder.
3. Start the job worker using:
   `python part-03-runner-online.py`
4. Ensure the worker starts correctly and connects to the cluster.
5. Open another terminal and navigate to the `clients` folder inside the `python` directory.
6. Start a process instance using:
   `python start-image-production-process.py mid_1`
7. Wait 30 seconds and go to Operate and open your process instance.
8. In the instance history, notice the `30 s` record which indicates that the timer event was triggered and the path pointing back to the gateway was taken.
   > The process diagram also shows how many times the service task was triggered.
9. To finish the instance, run:
   `python send-image-rendering-message.py mid-1 iid-1 0.8`

---

### 2. Exception handling caused by an Error

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Stop the job workers first: `ctrl+C`

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the `python/windows` folder.
3. Start the job worker using:
   `python part-03-runner-online.py`
4. Ensure the worker starts correctly and connects to the cluster.
5. Open another terminal and navigate to the `clients` folder inside the `python` directory.
6. Start a process instance using:
   `python start-image-production-process.py mid-1`
7. To continue the instance, run:
   python send-image-rendering-message.py mid-1 iid-1 0.4

   > The value `0.4` indicates low image quality. After enhancement, it becomes `0.6`, which still falls below the 0.7 threshold, triggering a business error.

8. Go to Operate and verify the path taken.
9. Watch the printout from your worker:

       üì¶ Thumbnails Production Worker in action with variables: {'imageId': 'iid-1', 'modelId': 'mid-1', 'imageRenderingQuality': 0.4, 'imageEnhancementQuality': 0.6000000000000001}
       üñºÔ∏è Processing image: iid-1
       üîç Rendering: 0.4, Enhancement: 0.6000000000000001, Thumbnails: 3
       üéØ Throwing BPMN Error: thumbnail-production-error ‚Äì Image quality insufficient for thumbnails
       ‚ö†Ô∏è Error occurred during task thumbnails_production
       ‚ùå Image quality insufficient for thumbnails!

---

‚úÖ At this point, you have successfully extended your BPMN model to handle timeouts and errors using a connected Python Job Worker!

‚ûï Bonus: If you have time left, try handling additional failure scenarios or introduce escalation paths.

## üõ† Required Tools

- Camunda Web Modeler  
- VS Code  
- Python 3.x

## üèÅ Outcome

By the end of this exercise, you will have transformed a simple BPMN model into a **fault-tolerant and resilient process**, capable of handling real-world exception scenarios dynamically through a Python Job Worker.

Great job and happy programming! üéâ
