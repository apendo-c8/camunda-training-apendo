## ✅ Instructions

### 1. Create a Camunda Cluster

- Navigate to the [Camunda Console](https://console.cloud.camunda.io/) and open the **Clusters** section.
- Click **Create Cluster**.
- Enter a name for your cluster (e.g., `training-cluster`).
- Set **Customer Type** to `Trial Cluster`.
- Leave the **Cluster Tag** as `dev`.
- Choose **GCP** as the cloud provider.
- Select **Belgium, Europe (europe-west1)** as the region.
- For **Version**, choose `Camunda 8.7+genX`.
- Disable **Automatic Cluster Patch Updates**.
- Click **Create Cluster** to finalize.

### 2. Generate Cluster Client Credentials

- Open your cluster and go to the **API** tab
- Click **"Create new client"**
- Set the name to **`training-client`**
- Select **`Zeebe`** as the scope
- Click **Create**
- Go to the **Env Vars** tab
- Click **Download credentials** and save the file to a secure location

Once downloaded, run the following command from your local clone of the training repository to convert the credentials to `.env` format:

```bash
python utils/convert_env.py [path/to/downloaded/file] bruno/training-collection/.env
```

Replace [path/to/downloaded/file] with the actual path to the downloaded environment file.

### 3. Create a Camunda Modeler Project

- Go to **Home** in [Camunda Web Modeler](https://modeler.camunda.io/)
- Click **"Create Project"**
- Name your Project (e.g., `Camunda Training`)

---

> ✅ At this point, you have successfully set up your Camunda cluster, generated credentials, and created a workspace for modeling your processes.

---

## 🛠 Required Tools

- [Camunda Console](https://console.cloud.camunda.io/)
- [Camunda Web Modeler](https://modeler.cloud.camunda.io/)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)

## 🏁 Outcome

You are now ready to build, deploy, and run BPMN processes in Camunda Platform 8 throughout the training.

**Great job and happy modeling! 🎉**
